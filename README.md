## Dolly Zoom
We will implement Dolly Zoom effect used by film-makers to create a sensation of vertigo, a "falling-away-from-oneself" feeling. 
This is meant to introduce the concepts of projection and focal length. It keeps the size of an object of interests constant
in the image, while making the foreground and background objects appear larger or smaller by adjusting focal length and moving 
the camera. We will simulate the Dolly Zoom effect with a synthetic scene as shown in figure below, which illustrates two cubes 
and one pyramid seen from the top view.
